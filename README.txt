This is my very first self-project in coding.
The solutions and code I have written here include a mixture of trial-and-error, suggestions from friends, and solutions stumbled upon from StackOverflow.

I stress that I have had no prior experience or education to this project.
Therefore, the code here may appear extremely "crude" or "unrefined" and will need to be refactored.

However, I think there is some merit in keeping it the way it is so that I can look back and be reminded of where I came from.
Regardless, this is my very first self-project. Enjoy!
